# Overview

This is a react native app made for IOS and Android with the help of expo. In this app the user will be able to add their weekly goals and be able to delete them upon accomplishment. As a college student is often hard to keep up with all the assignments and appointment we have going on, so by using the app, students, teacher or any other user will be able to have a clear view of their assignments for the week.

The app is very straight forward, it has an add goal button with a text window where you can type the goal you would like to add to the list. It then adds it to the list and if you wish to remove, you must tap in the goal.

I have been learning react.js and making basic websites and I really like this framework. Then I wanted to step it up and create and app for mobiles devices and I was on the fence about doing an android app or an IOS app. With react native you can create an app for both without having to alter it too much, it sounded really appealing and I wanted to deepen my understand of the language so I created this app to further my knowledge.
